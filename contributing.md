- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Descriptions should not be title-case.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Links to GitHub must follow the following format: `[owner/repo](https://github.com/owner/repo) - Description.`.
- Additions should be added in alphabetical order.
- Link to the GitHub repo if possible, not a package manager or its website.
- The pull request should have a useful title and explain why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.
- Submissions may not violate Twitch's Terms and Conditions.

Thank you for your suggestion!

### Updating your PR

If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
